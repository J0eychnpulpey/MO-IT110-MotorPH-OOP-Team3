 * PhilHealthCalculator - PhilHealth employee share: 50% of the premium (3% rate with a PHP 300
 * floor and a PHP 1,800 ceiling), so the deduction runs from PHP 150 to PHP 900
 * (MS1 Week 3 CRC: "PhilHealthCalculator (Concrete Subclass)").
 *
 * Decision B (2026-10-27): the premium formula is carried over from CP2 unchanged, but the
 * EMPLOYEE SHARE is applied. The official matrix states the premium is equally shared between
 * employee and employer (Home_Philhealth_Matrix.xlsx note A6; SAMPLE B10 = 375 on a 25,000
 * basic salary). CP2 returned the full premium, which over-deducted every payslip by 2x -
